//! Reducer API (SPEC-004 §2, T3.2): [`ReducerContext`] — the first parameter
//! of every reducer — and the typed [`TxHandle`] read/write surface bound to
//! the call's transaction, plus the [`ReducerRegistry`] that dispatches
//! reducers by name and lets a reducer call another reducer inside the same
//! transaction (RED-005).
//!
//! # How the pieces fit (the T3.3 engine seam)
//!
//! The transaction pipeline ([`crate::txn::TxPipeline`], T3.1) executes
//! `FnOnce(&mut Tx) -> Result<()>` jobs. This module turns a raw [`Tx`] into
//! the module-author API: the engine wraps a `ReducerCall` as
//!
//! ```ignore
//! pipeline.call(Box::new(move |tx| {
//!     registry.dispatch(caller, &name, &args, tx)
//! })).await
//! ```
//!
//! and every table access inside the reducer goes through `ctx.tx`. Closures
//! (tests, lifecycle hooks) enter the same way via [`with_context`].
//!
//! # Design decisions (T3.2)
//!
//! - **`&ReducerContext`, not `&mut`** (RED-001): reducers take a shared
//!   reference — the ergonomic shape every SPEC-004 example uses — so
//!   [`TxHandle`] reaches the underlying single-writer [`Tx`] through a
//!   [`RefCell`]. Reducer execution is single-threaded by construction
//!   (TXN-010: one writer per shard) and every method scopes its borrow
//!   internally, so the cell can never be contended; `try_borrow` failures
//!   are surfaced as errors rather than panics to keep the reducer path
//!   unwind-free (RED-061).
//! - **Read isolation is explicit** (TXN-050/051, FR-17): [`TxHandle::scan`],
//!   [`TxHandle::query_pk`], and [`TxHandle::scan_where`] read the committed
//!   pre-transaction snapshot only — never this call's pending writes.
//!   Read-your-own-writes goes through [`TxHandle::scan_pending`] /
//!   [`TxHandle::count_pending`] / [`TxHandle::scan_all`] /
//!   [`TxHandle::scan_all_where`], which method a reducer uses being an
//!   explicit, reviewable statement of intent.
//! - **Nested calls share one transaction, no savepoints** (RED-005,
//!   TXN-051): [`TxHandle::call`] runs the callee against the same `TxState`.
//!   An `Err` from the callee propagates to the caller, which may handle it
//!   or let it roll back the whole transaction. There is no partial rollback:
//!   writes the callee buffered *before* failing remain in the transaction if
//!   the caller handles the error and commits — SPEC-003 has no savepoints.
//! - **Recursion is capped** ([`MAX_CALL_DEPTH`]): unbounded
//!   reducer-calls-reducer recursion would overflow the stack, and a stack
//!   overflow aborts the process instead of unwinding — the one failure
//!   RED-061's `catch_unwind` cannot isolate. The cap turns it into an
//!   ordinary rollback error.
//! - **Typed rows ride the [`Table`] conversions** (DM-043): `#[fluxum::table]`
//!   generates `into_values`/`from_values`/`pk_values`, so this module is
//!   plain plumbing — no per-table codegen, no reflection. Decoded rows are
//!   cloned out of the store's `Arc`-shared [`Row`]s; payload copies happen
//!   only for owned column types (`String`, `Vec<_>`).
//! - **Index and spatial typed accessors are deliberately absent**: their
//!   ergonomic surface (`query_index`, `spatial_radius` — RED-003) needs the
//!   query/argument model of the SDK and view tasks (T3.4+, SPEC-008/011);
//!   until then reducers reach them through the engine-level seams on
//!   [`Tx`] itself ([`Tx::index_eq`], [`Tx::spatial_radius`]).
